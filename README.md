6.00x
=====

These are my solutions to the open course
[MITx 6.00x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming]
(https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2013_Spring/info)
 (2013 spring session).

If you cannot find 6.00x on edX, it is probably supplanted by
[6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python]
(https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-2841).

Note: solutions to some trivial problems may not be available.
